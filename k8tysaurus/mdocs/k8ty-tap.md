## About

K8TY-Tap is a [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh) tap repository. Scala apps are
built via sbt using scalameta/sbt-native-image plugin. Build times are quite slow,
but the startup speeds are quite fast!

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install k8ty-app/k8ty-tap/<formula>`

Or `brew tap k8ty-app/k8ty-tap` and then `brew install <formula>`.
