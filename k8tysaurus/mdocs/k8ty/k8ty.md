Hello, and welcome to k8ty.app! This site is part personal blog + part docs for some projects - mainly published under
my GitHub Org: k8ty-app. You'll find that most things are Scala and/or Kubernetes related 😁. This particular section of the site goes over some of the dev-ops details of running all this stuff - perhaps you will find it helpful if you're looking to do the same!

As a note about the name of the site, it's a play on Kubernetes and Cats. Kubernetes is often referred to by its [numeronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym) `k8s`. Domestic cat's are some times referred to as kitty-cats. I've named my domesticated k8s cluster k8ty cat, with it's collection of k8ty apps 🤪

If you have any question/comments/feedback/pull-requests feel free to send me a message via EMail (mark@k8ty.app), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alterationx10), or [GitHub](https://github.com/k8ty-app)!
