                    This site currently supports user registration, and sign in via GitHub. Simply click "Log In with GitHub",
                    and you will get a pop-up to authorize the app to access your GitHub account.

                    This will create a k8ty.app user (with it's own unique UID, and identified by your email address), which is used to access various services
                    across k8ty.app. Some GitHub auth provider information is tied to this user account, and is used for display purposes to you only,
                    the logged in user. A k8ty.app user database record is also auto generated, tied only to your k8ty.app UID, and used to persist k8ty.app service settings/info.
                    None of your personal auth provider information is persisted to it.

                <p>
                    At any time, you can de-authorize access to this app in GitHub, and if you choose to delete your account (self-serve button coming soon), the corresponding database record
                    gets deleted automatically along with it.
