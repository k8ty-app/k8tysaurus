# About

Hello, and welcome to K8TY.APP! This site is part personal blog + part project documentation - mainly published under
my GitHub Org: [k8ty-app](https://github.com/k8ty-app). You'll find that most things are Scala and/or Kubernetes related 😁.

As a note about the name of the site, it's a play on Kubernetes and Cats. Kubernetes is often referred to by its 
[numeronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym) `k8s`. Domestic cats are some times referred to as kitty-cats. 
I've named my domesticated k8s cluster k8ty cat, with its collection of k8ty apps 🤪

If you have any question/comments/feedback/pull-requests feel free to send me a message via EMail (mark@k8ty.app), 
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/alterationx10), or [GitHub](https://github.com/k8ty-app)!
