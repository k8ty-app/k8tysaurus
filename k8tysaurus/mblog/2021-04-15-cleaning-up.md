I've restructured the site a bit to be more blog-focused.

The previous landing page to my site was mostly useless, so I've ditched it, and set the default routing
to land on the blog section. Hopefully, I'll have time to write some Scala-centric posts!

In addition, I also cleaned up the documentation page - the empty pages have been removed until there is actually some content
for them, and I'm working towards streamlining the sidebar to be more repo-specific.

On the horizon: I've been working on a CLI app to deploy simple apps to kubernetes sort of heroku style. 
It needs a couple pre-reqs documented, which I hope to have up soon, but in the meantime you can check the repo out at
